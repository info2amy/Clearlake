# Project Overview

## Project Name

Clearlake - A Family Happening!

## Project Description

This site is about family! For 5 generations now, family ( quite an extended one now! ) has gathered together at this privately owned property to fellowship, relax, and just do life together. This site will start documenting the history of the family as a whole and the founding of Clearlake, and also allow input about each of the family branches. Then, family will also be able to add posts about currents events.

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

I have a good eye for style, appeal and balance of the pages.

### Weaknesses:

It takes me additional time to work through the creation / rendering process with React.

### Opportunities:

This app will exercise my learning of React, and be the basis of a fun tool for my family, eventually.

### Threats:

I have so many ideas to implement into this app in the future, but I need to stick solidifying the basics before branching out.
